# Express Server

## Where the idea came from

The assignment was given to create a server using express and I am still trying to fully master this, so I did a simple post, users, locations (with a travel blog in mind) server, similar to what we did in class.

## Tech

I used a number of open source projects in order to work properly:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (AKA the bane of my existence)
- Express and Node
- Mockaroo for data

And of course this is in a public repository on GitHub.
